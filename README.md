# Asteroids (2D)

This is a fork of the Asteroid Clone provided by [@zigurous] (https://github.com/zigurous),
where the main character is driven by an AI programmed using the [ThinkEngine](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/ThinkEngine) Unity plugin.
The ASP encodings driving the player's brain can be found in the Assets/StreamingAssets folders.

## Original readme

 Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh and released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.
